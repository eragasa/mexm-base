Materials Ex Machina base code

The Materials Ex Machina code is a refactor of the code base of pypospack, which was written the requirements for Eugene J. Ragasa's PhD requirements at the University of Florida.  The original code base was written primarily to deal with the problem of potential optimization.  The code base for Materials Ex Machina looks to use the same programming components for fast calculations using interatomic potentials, but also more expensive computational materials science simulations which requires management of simulations using MPI.

These tutorials are written for the OSC cluster, where the pitzer has 40 cores per node.

Some optimizaitons are provided here, but are currently undocumented.  For massively parrallel simulations, NPAR should be set:
if n_cores_per_node is the number of cores per computational cluster, then NPAR < sqrt(n_cores_per_node) and n_cores_per_node is divisable by NPAR and LREAL = .FALSE.
